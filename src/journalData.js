      "I went on my first cruise with my family across the Caribbean. We stopped at 6 different islands over the span of 7 days. We got to discover the white-sand beaches and rugged cliffs of Barbados, see the towering mountains like Petit Piton in St. Lucia, wander down the colorful streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was the perfect trip to decompose and soak in many of the Caribbean's relaxing beaches and vibrant streets.",

      "I travelled to the Bahamas for my uncle's wedding. Absolutely breathtaking, and by far the most clearest and vibrant waters I've seen. The towns such as Nassau and Freeport have such lively streets and are full of culture and beautiful installations by local artists. I really could not get over how vibrant and beautiful the island is.",

      "Although, I've already been to Montreal numerous times, this was my first solo trip. I visited two art museums, ventured to new cafes and brunch spots, taking the Metro to navigate. I love the feeling I get, it's like Canada's own mini version of Europe. And I got to practice my French with the locals!",

      "NYC is by far one of my favourite cities to visit. I love the city, the culture, the diversity, the fact that it never sleeps. I love that you'll never run out of things to do, foods to eat, places to visit or people to meet. Each time I go, I always feel inspired with life.",
